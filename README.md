## My Process

### Hardest Part

Getting the `picture` to behave as I want. It was quite frustrating. But I'm happy with the result now.

### What I Learned

Container queries are extremely astounding!

Also, if your browser supports container queries, you might notice that removing <code>isolation:&nbsp;isolate;</code> from `.card` won't alter anything at all. Looks like `container-type` can create a new stacking context by itself. Yet, `isolation` is still needed for browsers that don't support container queries. So it's not there for no purpose --like, of course. But it would still break in IE either ways, though.&nbsp;üôÉ

### Continued Development

I need to spend more time studying CSS's fundamental principles and concepts.

## Tools

- [Dev Docs](https://devdocs.io) - The resource I was constantly referring to throughout the process. It's an offline web app that has a huge collection of documentations.
- [Brackets](https://brackets.io) - My text editor. Not as powerful as VS Code, but still my favorite.
- Chrome - This web page was only tested on Chrome.
